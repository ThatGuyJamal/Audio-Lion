**Audio Lion** is a simple audio player and downloader for windows.

## Features

- [x] Play audio from local disk

- [ ] Download audio from YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.

- [ ] Play audio from URL

## Known Bugs/Issues

1. Playing audio on some devices (speakers/headphones) over 48kHz (16bit) breaks the decoding process. This is a known bug and will be fixed before version 0.1.0.
    - Temporary fix: convert audio to 48kHz or lower. You can do this by changing the sample rate in your sound settings on your device.
2. Like the first bug, when the player breaks it causes the application to now play anymore audio. This is also a known bug and will be fixed before version 0.1.0.
    - Temporary fix: restart the application.
